Welcome to leap core!
===================
I'm here to provide to the leap stack the core classes to be used among the leap framework.

You don't have much advantage of using only this module as a dependency and it should be more an internal module.

My stack is based on:
-------------
* [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Install the dependencies:
Open terminal and type:
```bash
$ npm install
```
If you are lazy
```bash
$ npm i
```
